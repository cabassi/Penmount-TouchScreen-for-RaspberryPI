If you have the rapseberry pi 2, follow these instruction :


1. compile the kernel

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

cd /home/pi
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux

cd linux
(was 'cd linux-rpi-4.1.y')

KERNEL=kernel7
make bcm2709_defconfig



make menuconfig
...It loads a command ligne program (gray background)
Then try to go into the device drivers configuration section, go to HID support, follow "Special HID drivers" and finaly select “penmount touch device”.
Then save and exit. Back to the black terminal

(if 'make menuconfig' returns error, install it: 
 sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev)

(sudo apt-get install bc)

Very long :
sudo make -j4 zImage modules dtbs


sudo make modules_install
sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/*.dtb /boot/
sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/*.dtb* /boot/overlays/
sudo cp arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/README /boot/overlays/
sudo scripts/mkknlimg arch/arm/boot/zImage /boot/$KERNEL.img

2. Restart the system
sudo reboot

3. After the release X11, no xinput_calibration is needed, 
of There's actually an incompatibility with xinput_calibration and the current version of X11.

Please refer touchscreen_calibration.md (Thanks to KurtJacobson)
